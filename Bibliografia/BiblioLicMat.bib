Throughout most of this book, non-Euclidean geometries in spaces of two or three dimensions are treated as specializations of real projective geometry in terms of a simple set of axioms concerning points, lines, planes, incidence, order and continuity, with no mention of the measurement of distances or angles. This synthetic development is followed by the introduction of homogeneous coordinates, beginning with Von Staudt's idea of regarding points as entities that can be added or multiplied. Transformations that preserve incidence are called colineations. They lead in a natural way to elliptic isometries or congruent transformations. Following a recommendation by Bertrand Russell, continuity is described in terms of order. Elliptic and hyperbolic geometries are derived from real projective geometry by specializing an elliptic or hyperbolic polarity which transforms points into lines (in two dimensions) or planes (in three dimensions) and vice versa. This treatment can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with algebra up to the elements of group theory. - Publisher. ",

He graduated from the University of Groningen in 1924 and obtained his doctor{\rq}s degree from Leiden University in 1927. He spent his early years as a high school teacher and administrator. He published extensively, and as his ability became known, he was made professor at the Technical University of Delft in 1941, and later rector of thatuniversity(1951--1959). Withhisencyclopedicknowledgeof19th-century geometry and his training in 20th-century rigor, he was able to make many contributions to elementary geometry, even as that subject was eclipsed by the modern emphasis on abstract mathematical structures. He also had a fruitful collaboration with engineers and made substantial contributions to kinematics, culminating in the book Theoretical Kinematics,withBernard Roth, in 1979. Throughout his life he was inspired by geometry and poetry, and favored elegant succinct proofs. This little book, ?rst published in 1944,then in a secondexpanded edition in 1987, gives us a glimpse into his way of thinking. It is a series of vignettes, each crafted with elegance and economy. See, for example, his proof of the Pythagorean theorem (1. 2), which requires only one additional line to be drawn. And who can imagine a simpler proof of the nine-point circle (4. 1)? There is ample coverage of the modern geometry of the triangle: the Simson line, Morley{\rq}s theorem, isogonal conjugates, the symmedian point, and so forth. ",

In plane (two dimensional) geometry, they are known as polygons and comprise such figures as triangles, squares, pentagons, etc. In solid (three dimensional) geometry they are known as polyhedra and include such figures as tetrahedra (a type of pyramid), cubes, icosahedra, and many more; the possibilities, in fact, are infinite! H. S. M. Coxeter's book is the foremost book available on regular polyhedra, incorporating not only the ancient Greek work on the subject, but also the vast amount of information that has been accumulated on them since, especially in the last hundred years. The author, professor of Mathematics, University of Toronto, has contributed much valuable work himself on polytopes and is a well-known authority on them. Professor Coxeter begins with the fundamental concepts of plane and solid geometry and then moves on to multi-dimensionality. Among the many subjects covered are Euler's formula, rotation groups, star-polyhedra, truncation, forms, vectors, coordinates, kaleidoscopes, Petrie polygons, sections and projections, and star-polytopes. Each chapter ends with a historical summary showing when and how the information contained therein was discovered. Numerous figures and examples and the author's lucid explanations also help to make the text readily comprehensible. Although the study of polytopes does have some practical applications to mineralogy, architecture, linear programming, and other areas, most people enjoy contemplating these figures simply because their symmetrical shapes have an aesthetic appeal. But whatever the reasons, anyone with an elementary knowledge of geometry and trigonometry will find this one of the best source books available on this fascinating study. ",

It covers three major areas of non-Euclidean geometry and their applica tions: spherical geometry (used in navigation and astronomy), projective geometry (used in art), and spacetime geometry (used in the Special The ory of Relativity). In addition it treats some of the more useful topics from Euclidean geometry, focusing on the use of Euclidean motions, and includes a chapter on conics and the orbits of planets. My aim in writing this book was to balance theory with applications. It seems to me that students of geometry, especially prospective mathe matics teachers, need to be aware of how geometry is used as well as how it is derived. Every topic in the book is motivated by an application and many additional applications are given in the exercises. This emphasis on applications is responsible for a somewhat nontraditional choice of top ics: I left out hyperbolic geometry, a traditional topic with practically no applications that are intelligible to undergraduates, and replaced it with the spacetime geometry of Special Relativity, a thoroughly non-Euclidean geometry with striking implications for our own physical universe. The book contains enough material for a one semester course in geometry at the sophomore-to-senior level, as well as many exercises, mostly of a non routine nature (the instructor may want to supplement them with routine exercises of his/her own).

It is designed to be used in an undergraduate course on geometry, and as such, its target audience is undergraduate math majors. However, much of it should be readable by anyone who is comfortable with the language of mathematical proof. Throughout, the goal is to develop the material patiently. One of the more appealing aspects of geometry is that it is a very visual subject. This book hopes to takes full advantage of that, with an extensive use of illustrations as guides.Geometry Illuminated is divided into four principal parts. Part 1 develops neutral geometry in the style of Hilbert, including a discussion of the construction of measure in that system, ultimately building up to the Saccheri-Legendre Theorem. Part 2 provides a glimpse of classical Euclidean geometry, with an emphasis on concurrence results, such as the nine-point circle. Part 3 studies transformations of the Euclidean plane, beginning with isometries and ending with inversion, with applications and a discussion of area in between. Part 4 is dedicated to the development of the Poincar{\'e} disk model, and the study of geometry within that model.While this material is traditional, Geometry Illuminated does bring together topics that are generally not found in a book at this level. Most notably, it explicitly computes parametric equations for the pseudosphere and its geodesics. It focuses less on the nature of axiomatic systems for geometry, but emphasizes rather the logical development of geometry within such a system. It also includes sections dealing with trilinear and barycentric coordinates, theorems that can be proved using inversion, and Euclidean and hyperbolic tilings. ",

Students are expected to read concurrently Books I-IV of Euclid's text, which must be obtained sepa rately. The remainder of the book is an exploration of questions that arise natu rally from this reading, together with their modern answers. To shore up the foundations we use Hilbert's axioms. The Cartesian plane over a field provides an analytic model of the theory, and conversely, we see that one can introduce coordinates into an abstract geometry. The theory of area is analyzed by cutting figures into triangles. The algebra of field extensions provides a method for deciding which geometrical constructions are possible. The investigation of the parallel postulate leads to the various non-Euclidean geometries. And in the last chapter we provide what is missing from Euclid's treatment of the five Platonic solids in Book XIII of the Elements.

The next, a natural continuation of the first, is a study of all three types of conic sections, the ellipse, the parabola and the hyperbola.The third theme is about certain properties of geometrical figures related to the problem of finding the largest area that can be enclosed by a curve of given length. This problem is called the isoperimetric problem. In itself, this topic contains motivation for major parts of the curriculum in mathematics at college level and sets the stage for more advanced mathematical subjects such as functions of several variables and the calculus of variations.The emergence of non-Euclidean geometries in the beginning of the nineteenth century represents one of the dramatic episodes in the history of mathematics. In the last theme the non-Euclidean geometry in the Poincar{\'e} disc model of the hyperbolic plane is developed. ",

Also included is a chapter on infinite-dimensional generalizations of Euclidean and affine geometries. A uniform approach to different geometries, based on Klein's Erlangen Program is suggested, and similarities of various phenomena in all geometries are traced. An important notion of duality of geometric objects is highlighted throughout the book. The authors also include a detailed presentation of the theory of conics and quadrics, including the theory of conics for non-Euclidean geometries. The book contains many beautiful geometric facts and has plenty of problems, most of them with solutions, which nicely supplement the main text. With more than 150 figures illustrating the arguments, the book can be recommended as a textbook for undergraduate and graduate-level courses in geometry. ",

Starting with the well-known optical properties of conics, the authors move to less trivial results, both classical and contemporary. In particular, the chapter on projective properties of conics contains a detailed analysis of the polar correspondence, pencils of conics, and the Poncelet theorem. In the chapter on metric properties of conics the authors discuss, in particular, inscribed conics, normals to conics, and the Poncelet theorem for confoca. ",

It reflects the new qualitative approach that is altering the learning of elementary differential equations, including the wide availability of scientific computing environments like Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB. Its focus balances the traditional manual methods with the new computer-based methods that illuminate qualitative phenomena and make accessible a wider range of more realistic applications. Seldom-used topics have been trimmed and new topics added: it starts and ends with discussions of mathematical modeling of real-world phenomena, evident in figures, examples, problems, and applications throughout the text.

It explains the solutions of linear equations with constant coefficients, operational calculus, and the solutions of linear differential equations. It also explores the techniques of computing for the solution of systems of linear differential equations, which is similar to the solutions of linear equations of arbitrary order. The text proves that if the coefficients of some differential equations possess certain restricted types of singularities, the solution will have Taylor series expansions about the singular points. The investigator can calculate a divergent series whose partial sums numerically approximate the solution for large x if the point in question is infinity, of which the series will be a Taylor series of negative powers of x. The book also explains the Fourier transform, its applications to partial differential equations, as well as the Hilbert space approach to partial differential equations. The book is a stimulating material for mathematicians, for professors, or for students of pure and applied mathematics, physics, or engineering. ",
